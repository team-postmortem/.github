**"Dissect Till Glory"**

## Who We Are

Team Postmortem is a group of four tech enthusiasts dedicated to reverse engineering in our free time. Our mission is to uncover the intricacies of technology, from software to hardware. We dissect software to understand its core functionalities, deconstruct hardware to study its components, identify vulnerabilities through security assessments, and share our knowledge to educate others in the field. Our work is driven by passion, curiosity, and the pursuit of knowledge. 

## Contact Us

Interested in our work or have a question? We'd love to hear from fellow technology enthusiasts. While we might be busy dissecting our latest project, we'll make sure to get back to you as soon as we can.
